# Flipping Utilities plugin for RuneLite
This external plugin seeks to help users with flipping in OSRS. It provides the latest prices and calculates profits according to the user's marginchecks.

**Disclaimer: This is not an OSBuddy Exchange replacement, as it does not send or receive price data from other users.**

## How it works
The plugin is designed to be "hands-free". This means you can just margin check an item you want to flip and the plugin will detect, store and display prices along with calculating the profits and return on investments (ROI).

**The plugin will only record bought and sold trades with a quantity of one.** I hope to address this in a future update.

You can use this box to quickly determine if the item is worth it to flip. The sell price is handy for when you're posting your flips, as you don't need to search through the GE history tab and remember the price.

Lastly, I've added tooltips to the price values, so that you can see when the prices were updated. If the price is outdated, the color of the respective value will show red. (Defaults to 30 minutes after margin check, but can be changed in the config)

## Potential future features
* Search bar
* Statistics tab that show how much profit you've earned during a time frame.
* Trade history
* GE limit history to show how many items you can buy before reaching the limit and when the limit ends.

## Support
This is my first RuneLite project/contribution and there are guaranteed to be mistakes. But I am determined to imporove and better my skills therefore, if you notice any bugs, have any suggestions or want to contribute to the plugin, I would appreciate it a lot if you opened an issue here or online.
