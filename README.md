# Flipping Utilities plugin for RuneLite
This external plugin seeks to help users with flipping in OSRS. It provides the latest prices and calculates profits according to the user's marginchecks. It also keeps track of how many remaining items you can buy in the 4-hour GE limit and when they will expire.

**Disclaimer: This is not an OSBuddy Exchange replacement, as it does not send or receive price data from other users.**

## How it works
The plugin is designed to be "hands-free". This means you can just margin check an item you want to flip and the plugin will detect, store and display prices along with calculating the profits and return on investments (ROI).

**The plugin will only record bought and sold trades with a quantity of one.**

You can use this box to quickly determine if the item is worth it to flip.

The plugin also detects when you are setting up an offer and will highlight that item in the panel such that it is easy to read the relevant information when setting up your offers. If you want to look at a specific item you've flipped before, you can easily just do a quick search on the search bar at the top of the panel that will then show the item below.

This plugin also features a lot of handy tooltips that will show you important information such as:
* GE limit tracking, so you can see the remaining items you can buy in the limit along with when the limit expires.

Lastly, a widget has recently been added to help you set up your offers quickly! The widget will show up in the chatbox when you want to set the price of your item, if you've margin checked it beforehand.

## Potential future features
* Statistics tab that show how much profit you've earned during a time frame.
* Trade history
* Optional notification when a GE limit expires.
* Favorited items.
* When setting up buy offers, provide an option to set quantity to only what you have gold for.
* Collapsing trades after the GE limit has been bought.
* Grouped checklist tab with import and export features so you can keep track of the items you like to flip most!

## Support
This is my first RuneLite project/contribution and there are guaranteed to be mistakes. But I am determined to improve and better my skills so therefore, if you notice any bugs, have any suggestions or want to contribute to the plugin, I would appreciate it a lot if you opened an issue here or messaged me online. (RSN: Beliael) You can also contact me on Discord at Belieal#6600.

v1.0 - Plugin added!

v1.1 - GE limit tracking added.

v1.1.1 - 12 hour format for clocks and various bug fixes.

## v1.2

* Added a search bar

* Added margin freezing, so you can now flip items with a quantity of one without changing the buy or sell prices. (Big thanks to @Zumaad for developing this!)

* Added flipping widget that will show up in the chatbox when you want to set the price and quantity of your item, if you've margin checked it beforehand.

* Added individual removal of items, so you can now click the item icon to remove it.

* Fixed an issue that caused prices to not show color.

* Fixed an issue that caused price colors to flicker.

* Various optimizations and smaller bug fixes.

## v1.3 - Statistics Tab update

This update added the statistics tab which contains a variety of useful stats about your flips! The panel features a large variety of sub information panels that tell you things such as:

* The amount of gp you've gained or lost along with the return on investment over the time span

* The total combined profits your flips accrued during the interval

* The hourly profit you've obtained during your session

* Statistics over every single item you've flipped

* View the flip history behind every item that you've flipped

... and much more!

This update also features all new multi-account support! You can now view the stats or flips your individual accounts have made separately. To turn it on, head to the config menu and check "Enable multi account tracking".

We've also added a whole new margin check detection system. This means we now determine if trades are margin checks by making sure that it completed instantly (2 game ticks, one for the RuneScape server to receive the trade offer and one for when it completes). We're confident that this will be the most accurate representation of a margin check detection system and thusly we've removed the old margin freezing feature, as it no longer serves a purpose. 

Lastly, we've added a ton of small bug fixes and general optimizations of the plugin. Unfortunately, we've had to disable the cloud sync feature, which means all your flips and stats are now stored locally. This was due to the amount of data we're requiring with this new statistics tab being too large for the way we synced RuneLite data. This local data is stored within your RuneLite directory (/flipping/trades.json). If you're a heavy user of this plugin, this may become a pretty large file so it is recommended that you reset your panels once in a while. This can be done by right-clicking the reset button in the top right of the panel.

This update has been long in the making and it definitely took a lot of work behind the scenes. Therefore, I couldn't have done it without the help from [Zumaad](https://github.com/zumaad), whose amazing work on the backend really made it all possible. Big thanks to you, my friend! ‚ù§
